# An Ode to 17 Databases in 39 minutes

A detailed, deep-diving, in-the-deep-end and occasionally humorous whirlwind introduction and analysis of a suite of modern (and sometimes delightfully archaic) database technologies. How they work, why they work, and when you might want them to work. 

At no extra charge I will also attempt to explain the oft-misunderstood CAP theorem, using databases as a device for understanding the trade offs and compromises inherent in building complex distributed systems.

Including but not limited to:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Cassandra
- Hyperdex
- MongoDb
- Riak
- Animated Gifs

This talk is loosely based on my (award winning) Lightning Talk presented at the 2013 Australian Ruby Conference "An Ode to 17 databases in 5 minutes".
A 30 minute version was presented at the September 2013 Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference in Boulder, Colorado to wild acclaim (or at least some mildy positive feedback).

Toby's hobbies include collecting programming languages and databases, playing the drums, cutting code and pondering the nature of existence.
