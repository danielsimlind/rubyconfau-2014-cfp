Mario and Keith both did a talk at the 2013 Ruby Australia Conference entitled "Keith and Mario's Guide to Fast Websites" ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/keithpitt/keith-and-marios-guide-to-fast-websites), [video](http://vimeo.com/61342267)). There was a great response from the talk, so much so they've been asked to be interviewed for books and do the talk at the Ottowa Ruby Meetup.
