# Keith and Mario's Guide to Continuous Deployment

Mario and I together performed a talk at the 2013 Ruby Australia Conference entitled "Keith and Mario's Guide to Fast Websites" ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/keithpitt/keith-and-marios-guide-to-fast-websites), [video](http://vimeo.com/61342267)). The talk was a lot of fun and we had a great response from the audience. We would love to come back again next year to perform another talk.

## A bit about the talk we'd like to perform

* Fast CI and tests
* Auto deploy from ci
* Feature flags
* Migrations
* Feature branch pull request delivery
* Zero downtime deploys
* Env for app config
* Rollback strategies
