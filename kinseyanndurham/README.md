Becoming a Software Engineer: Inspiring a New Generation of Developers

In my wildest dreams, I never thought that I would become a software developer.
I thought that I wasn't smart enough, that I needed a computer science degree
and to have been writing code since I was young. But, the traditional path to
becoming a developer is changing. This talk will focus on alternative and
untraditional paths to becoming a developer such as programs like Railsbridge,
mentorship and apprentice programs. These alternative paths ultimately foster a
more diverse and inclusive community, which drives economic growth and produces
more innovative solutions. 
The objectives of the talk are: 
- to bring awareness to the educational alternatives to computer science degrees 
- to encourage empathy when mentoring a beginner 
- to get the audience to see a different perspective and embrace differences in
  the industry
