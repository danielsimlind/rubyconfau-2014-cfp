# The Parental Programmer

Programming can be an all consuming job. So can parenting. 

How do you keep up with new technology, contribute to open source, earn some money, and be there for your children?  What do you focus on and what do you discard?  Is it even possible to do it all?

As the mother of a 3 month old, I certainly don't have all the answers. This talk will collate suggestions from programming parents all around the world, so we can make new mistakes going forward, instead of repeating those of the past.
