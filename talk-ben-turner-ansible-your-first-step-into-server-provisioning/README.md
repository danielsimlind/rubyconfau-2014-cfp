# Ansible - your first step into server provisioning

The ability to repeatably and automatically build your servers in code is essential for managing a modern Ruby application's server infrastructure.

Solutions such as Chef and Puppet are often used to solve this issue, but for some teams, this might be too costly to learn and implement effecitvely. Bridging the gap between these larger solutions and shell scripting is Ansible, a light footprint provisioning tool using SSH and YAML files to quickly define repeatable server creation and configuration steps.

This talk will cover:
* introduce server provisioning at a high level
* explain how Ansible fits into that pattern
* describe simple Ansible commands and modules
* run through a basic playbook example, bringing these elements together
* summarise other functionality offered by Ansible

With 15 years of development experience in Ruby and Java across various industries, Ben has worked across all parts of the development stack, and more recently on operations and infrastructure code to support a faster, simpler deployment process. Recently this has taken him on a tour of provisioning software, and led toward Ansible for lighter, simpler server setup.
