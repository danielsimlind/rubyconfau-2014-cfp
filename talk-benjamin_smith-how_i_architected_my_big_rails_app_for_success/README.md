# How I architected my big Rails app for success

Rails is a great framework for creating web apps... for awhile. What do you do when your codebase grows large? How do you handle large teams of developers? When performance becomes an issue, how do you scale? Most importantly, how do you write code which can easily be refactored later?

This is a story of a real life project built from day 1 with all these questions in mind. Learn about the problems we solved and lessons we learned: how to partition your Rails app into distinct modular engines, how to speed up your test suite by only running code effected by your changes, how to add a layer on top of ActiveRecord to enforce loose coupling, and many other patterns that can be applied to your own Rails apps!
