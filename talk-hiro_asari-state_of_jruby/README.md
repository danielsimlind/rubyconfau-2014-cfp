# State of JRuby 2014

JRuby is a fast implementation of the Ruby language on the Java Virtual
Machine.

You may wonder if it can be faster.
You may have heard of the slow startup time. Can it load faster?
You may have heard that your favorite C extension does not work on
JRuby. What about cross-platform C extension API?

This talk will discuss these questions.

This year (2014), the project will release a major milestone:
JRuby [9000](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sl2ujx1syt7kqzh/8000.mov) (ä»®).
Main new features of this release include:
  * Ruby 2.1 compatibility
  * New compiler
  * Better InvokeDynamic experience

A JRuby core team member Hiro Asari will discuss these topics.
