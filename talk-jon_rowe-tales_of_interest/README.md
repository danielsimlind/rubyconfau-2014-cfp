# Tales Of Interest

So you want to be an open source contributor? Think you can handle supporting
multiple rubies, tracking down weird bugs, stomaching all that the wider developer
eco system can throw at you? Well good reader, I can tell you stories that will
turn your stomach, and blind your eyes.

Let me take you on a journey deep into the depths of open source triage and
follow the kind of madness that comes from tracking down bugs across differing
versions of Ruby and VMs.

Finally let me entertain you with stories of the perils of dogfooding your
testing framework, and throw in some stories about the kind of hackery you
can commit with a bit of mischievousness.

## Jon Rowe

Tinker. Sailor. Developer. Spy? Originally from a tiny cold island nation,
Britain, Jon now lives in Sydney where he spends time sailing the high seas,
plotting and working as a gun for hire, I mean freelance Ruby developer.

When not working on client work you can find Jon hacking on RSpec (as a core
contributor), helping other open source projects and working on his own little
side project(s).
