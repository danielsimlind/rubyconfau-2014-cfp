# Learning from Smalltalk

Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language. 
Smalltalk is a "pure" object-oriented programming language, meaning that, unlike 
Java and C++, there is no difference between values which are objects and values 
which are primitive types. In Smalltalk, primitive values such as integers, booleans 
and characters are also objects, in the sense that they are instances of corresponding 
classes, and operations on them are invoked by sending messages.

Sound familiar?

Smalltalk leaves a long shadow on the programming landscape and can be considered 
both as an ancestor and influence on the design of Ruby.

This talk introduces Smalltalk to Rubyists and covers software principles which 
can be applied to Ruby applications, both large and small. We'll cover 

Topics include:
* Brief overview
* Design
* Expressions
* Literals
* Messages
* Patterns
* Reflection
