# Teach Your Way To Better Code

You may have this vague sense that you don't know Ruby as well as you think you do.
And you worry that you're not learning and growing as a developer in your day job
as much as you did when you first picked up Ruby. Perhaps you've lost that spark
of excitement you experienced when you discovered new ways to solve problems with Ruby.

There is a way to re-invigorate your code and coding practices. Teach everything you know.

This talk will focus on some of the principals of teaching and why it can be an effective
tool, not only for others to learn, but for you as the teacher to really deepen your
knowledge of the subject. It will be specifically centered around using Ruby, and some of
the ways I have discovered work well for teaching it as a first programming language.

## My Name

My name is [Felix Clack](http://felixclack.com), I run a class called [Rails Kickstart](http://railskickstart.com),
which is delivered online and also in person via [General Assembly](http://generalassemb.ly) in London.

After 6 years building products for numerous startups as a consultant, I discovered a passion for teaching
that has made me into a better developer. I hope that I can pass on some of that passion for you to discover
for yourself the benefits of teaching everything you know.
