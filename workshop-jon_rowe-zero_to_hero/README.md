# Testing - Zero To Hero

So testing... How does it work?

What is a unit test? Why is that an integration test, should I even bother with
acceptance tests? Let's work through the differences between the various types
of testing, look at differing strategies for tackling problems and how they can
be solved.

Try doing things with TDD, try doing things building tests after. Let's use
RSpec, TestUnit and MiniSpec to test different techniques and perfect our
tests.

Look at how we can apply these to our real world problems to make our lives
easier and our software better!
