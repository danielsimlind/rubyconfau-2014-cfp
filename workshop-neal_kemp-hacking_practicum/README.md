# Hacking Practicum

Have you ever dreamed of hacking a mainframe or infiltrating the network of a
shady government organization? In this workshop, I will get you one step closer
to achieving your dream.

You will learn about the most prevalent attack methods used to exploit Ruby
applications by actually hacking some apps. There will be no theory and no
fancy-talk--just hacking. For each attack method we cover, I will take you
through three steps--detection, exploitation, and patching. Towards the end, I
will share tools used by security experts to automate the detection and
exploitation process.

Some attack methods you will learn more about:

* Cross-site request forgery
* Social engineering
* Cross-site-scripting
* Password attacks
* Rails-specific attacks


This talk is aimed at Ruby developers of any skill-level who want to learn more
about security via hacking. By the end of the talk, you will be able to detect,
exploit, and patch various security vulnerabilities. I will use Rails and
Sinatra as hacking mediums, but the attack methods learned will apply to any
Ruby application.

In the past, he has worked as developer at thoughtbot and ZURB. Neal's composition
is one part developer one part hacker. He has been developing on the web
since marquees were cool, and his interest in security started when he began
exploiting vulnerabilities on Myspace for fun.

He hails from Iowa where he had the choice between yanking
[tassels](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detasseling) off of corn
and yanking lines in VIM. While he has done both, he has decided to stick with
the latter. When he's not writing code in a dark basement, you can find him
cycling, climbing, or travelling.
