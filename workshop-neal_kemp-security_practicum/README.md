# Security Practicum

Believe it or not, proper application security isn't just for banks!
Recent high-profile attacks have cost web companies millions of dollars and
thousands of users. To protect your users, you must learn how attackers would
exploit your application.

You will learn about the most prevalent attack methods used to exploit Ruby
applications by hacking demo apps. There will be no theory and no fancy-talk
--just hacking. For each attack method we cover, I will take you through
three steps--detection, exploitation, and patching. We will also learn about
tools to automate the detection process.

Some attack methods you will learn more about:

* Cross-site request forgery
* Social engineering
* Cross-site-scripting
* Password attacks
* Rails-specific attacks


This talk is aimed at Ruby developers of any skill-level who want to learn how
to better secure their applications. I will use Rails and Sinatra as mediums,
but the attack methods learned will apply to any Ruby application.
